:cfdo %s/O\./LV./gc

    The % is a line range that specifies every line
    The g flag says to substitute all occurrences in each line
    The c flag causes vim to ask you to confirm each replacement individually (you might want to leave this out)
# Write all the changes
:cfdo update   or :wa write all changes(multiple times)  

# This file had a lot of occurrences of 'O.'.  Made sure not to change it

# So I manually cloned the plugin
git clone https://github.com/tamago324/nlsp-settings.nvim.git ~/.local/share/lunarvim/site/pack/packer/start
